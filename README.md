# Assignment
---
In this final assignment, we'll finish off by adding a detail-screen for a selected film. The result will look something like this:

**Template:**
No need to use any other template, this repo is more than enough! üòÅ

**Objectives:**
1. Clone this template repo to get started. The original layout has already been added for you, so you don't have to copy and paste it from part 02. Feel free to do so if you'd like!

2. Start by scanning through the project first. How does it work? What connections have been made? Where does the external data come in? While you're at it, you might as well take a look at the online database!

3. Next, try to get the detail-screen to match the original styling as much as possible. Modify the _FilmDetailScreen.java_ file and add your code to it. A film object has been passed onto it already, so use this to your advantage. _Hint: you'll have to modify the Film object to be able to use all of the dynamic data._

4. Code quality with regard to reliability, readability, adaptability, maintainability, safety and / or performance should be high.

5. Commit and push your solution to the GitHub repo, and let us know via the hand-in button beneath.
